# Guess-my-number
 Quick fun game that guesses the number. 


How it works; 

Guess the number in the range that is listed. 

Every time the number is correct, 5 lives are added and the range increase. 

If an guess is wrong, your number of lives decrease. 




CHALLENGES --- 

Learn most of the code from udemy course. I expanded the course to make an integrated level system. 

Once of the main challenges was to have the random generator increase in increments of 5 for each level. 

Learned to make a value that is used inside the random generated. For every successful guess, it increases the ranges by 5 - matching the next level. 


learned the disable button function to prevent over usage of the Next-level and check btn. 


Also use the enter and space on the keyboard to active an event listner
